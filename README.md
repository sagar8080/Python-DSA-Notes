# Python-DSA-Notes
This project aims to revise key data structures and algorithms in Python. 
The revisions will be organized into three parts:
- **Coding Pattern (README File)**: This will provide an overview of the coding pattern, its use cases, and examples.
- **Problem Questions**: A list of questions to understand and practice the coding pattern.
- **LeetCode Questions**: A selection of LeetCode questions that demonstrate the application of the coding pattern.

## Coding Pattern
- The coding pattern is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves identifying recurring patterns in coding problems and applying them to solve new problems efficiently. 
- This section will cover various coding patterns used in data structures and algorithms.

## Problem Questions
- This section will provide a list of problem questions that can help you understand and practice the coding pattern. 
- Each question will be accompanied by a brief description and a link to the problem for further details.

## LeetCode Questions
- LeetCode is a platform that provides a collection of coding problems to help you practice and improve your coding skills. 
- This section will feature a selection of LeetCode questions that demonstrate the application of the coding pattern in real-world scenarios.
